			<h1>Info on old poorly documented computer parts: How to fix your old broken computer</h1>
			<p>This weekend I shipped out my old desktop and had to figure out what was wrong with it. Not only was it broken before, I also had taken it apart and damaged parts.</p>
			<p>Sound like something you might do? Let's talk through all of the problems I had to solve.</p>
      

			<h2>Instructions for the careful: Something is probably broken.</h2>
			<p>Let's start easy. It's an old computer. Your HDD is likely going to be corrupted. Fix that. On another computer. </p>
      <p>Next. Power Supply. Get a cheap new one and see if that was the problem. You can do this for 40$. If it's not the problem, keep it. </p>
      <p>I assume your HDD and PSU were both trashed. Mine were. This still wasn't my problem, though replacing them now allowed my computer to primary boot. </p>
      <p>Did you upgrade your BIOS? Is your flash drive partitioned correctly? Your Hard Drive? Are all external USB devices unplugged? </p>
      <p>You're careful - at least now. You feel as though you checked everything. Things are not acting how they are supposed to - they are not acting like others' problems either. </p>
      <p>But your computer is still not working. Here is my useful information, that I have never seen online. </p>


      <h2>Instructions for the careless: You probably broke something.</h2>
			<p>I knew my problem had something to do with my Motherboard or CPU. In fact, it almost seemed to be both. </p>
			<p>In my case, a long time ago, when trying to repair the pc, I dropped something on the pins where my CPU is seated. </p>
			<p>Upon inspecting my pins, I noticed some were bent - and touching! This (of course) is bad. </p>
      <p>Using a small tool, I was able to bend the pins back into place. I have had no trouble since. </p>
